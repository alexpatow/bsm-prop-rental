After installing the dependencies, in the terminal (from the root folder) run:

    - this should clone the github repo

    - starts the server at http://localhost:3000
    - this will restart the server when changes are made

## Adding new pages
This site uses the pages within the ```_posts/``` folder to generate the individual prop pages. These markdown documents are generated by placing images and text in the ```assets/``` folder. The assets folder should be structured as follows: ```./assets/:category/:page/``` where :category is the category of the prop, and :page is the name of the prop. What is stored in the :page folder should be images ('JPG', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'PNG', 'png', or 'tiff' extensions) or a file called ```desc.txt```. The images are used in the prop page image viewer and the desc.txt is used to generate a description of the prop, if desired.

The command ```node images-to-md.js``` is used to create the markdown documents in the ```_posts/``` folder from the images and desc.txt documents you have just inserted into the ```assets/``` folder.

## Adding new categories
In addition to creating new pages, the category should be added to the array in ```_data/propcategories.json```.

## Styling
This project uses SCSS (http://sass-lang.com/) for styling. It is compiled when ```gulp``` is run. All of the custom styles are in ```_scss/main.scss```. The project uses skeleton (http://getskeleton.com/) for basic styling.

## Deploying
TBD.
